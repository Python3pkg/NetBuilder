#          Neural Network Builder
This repository contains code related to machine learning. Currently, the active
project is in the folder ANNs, where the neural network class resides.
The neural network class is in NeuralNet.py
It allows to easily create fully connected feedforward networks of
any size allowed by available memory. It uses numpy arrays as the primary
data structure for the weight matrices. 
With this class you can create deep neural networks very quickly (see some 
of the example files to see how to use it).
