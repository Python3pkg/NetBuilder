I wrote the code in this folder during the summer of 2015 when I was first learnig
about neural networks. They use my matrix class which is very inefficient ( Matrix class
is available under a different repository than machine_learning). When I have time, I will
review this code and make it work. It was written with object-oriented design in mind. There
is a Network class, a layer class, and Neuron class, and they should all work together.
There are many errors in the code for now, mainly due to the Matrix class.
